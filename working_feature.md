Memory-game-multiplayer:
I made it so that the user could take turns playing with another player and that it would correctly keep track of the points as well as allow the player who got a match to play again. 

Memory-game-responsive:
 I made it to the fruit border dynamically changed but it also seemed to break everything else.
